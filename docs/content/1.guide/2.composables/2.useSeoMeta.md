# useSeoMeta

The `useSeoMeta` composable lets you define your sites SEO Meta as a flat object with full TypeScript support.

This helps you avoid common mistakes, such as using `name` instead of `property` as well typos with over 100+ meta tags fully typed.

This is the recommended way to add meta tags to your site as it is XSS safe and has full TypeScript support.

## Example

```ts
useSeoMeta({
  title: 'About',
  description: 'My about page',
  ogDescription: 'Still about my about page',
  ogTitle: 'About',
  ogImage: 'https://example.com/image.png',
  twitterCard: 'summary_large_image',
})
```

## Optional: Treeshake Plugin

When using the [Treeshake Plugin](/guide/getting-started/treeshake-plugin), the composable will be removed from the client build, getting you an extra performance boost.

## How it works

Powered by the [zhead](https://github.com/harlan-zw/zhead) schema and `unpackMeta` function. Unhead knows which meta tags belong where, as well
as all the quirks.
