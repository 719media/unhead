title: Tag Position
description: How tags are sorted and how to configure it.
---

By default, tags are rendered in the order they are added.

However, this is not always useful, some tags need to be in certain positions to work. To resolve position issues
this package uses implementing critical tags sorting and the user configured `tagPosition`.

## Critical Tag Sorting

A sorting algorithm is used to ensure that critical tags are always in the correct order.

The following tags have set priorities:

- `-2` &lt;meta charset ...&gt;
- `-1` &lt;base&gt;
- `0` &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-security-policy&quot; ...&gt;

All other tags have a default priority of 10: <meta>, <script>, <link>, <style>, etc

## Tag Position

You can also set custom priorities for tags using the `tagPosition` attribute.

You can either provide a number or a string beginning with `before:` or `after:` and target a tag key.

## Sort by number

When providing a number, refer to the default priorities in [Crticial Tag Sorting](#critical-tag-sorting).

```ts
const head = createHead()
head.push({
  script: [
    {
      src: '/not-important-script.js',
    },
  ],
})
head.push({
  script: [
    {
      src: '/very-important-script.js',
      tagPosition: 0,
    },
  ],
})

// <script src=\"/very-important-script.js\"></script>
// <script src=\"/not-important-script.js\"></script>
```


## Sort with `before:` and `after:`

When providing a string, you can use `before:` or `after:` to target a tag key.

Tag keys are prefixed with their tag name to avoid dedupe collisions, so you need to use the form of `{tagName}:{key}`.

```ts
const head = createHead()
head.push({
  script: [
    {
      key: 'not-important',
      src: '/not-important-script.js',
    },
  ],
})
head.push({
  script: [
    {
      // script is the tag name to target, `not-important` is the key we're targeting  
      tagPosition: 'before:script:not-important',
      src: '/must-be-first-script.js',
    },
  ],
})
// <script src=\"/must-be-first-script.js\"></script>
// <script src=\"/not-important-script.js\"></script>
```
