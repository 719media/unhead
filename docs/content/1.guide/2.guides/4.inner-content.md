title: Tag Inner Content
description: How tags are sorted and how to configure it.
---

For tags set inner content, such as `<style>` and `<script>`, you can set the inner content using the `children` attribute.

## `children`

For backwards compatibility and readability you can provide `innerHTML` and `textContent` as well.

It's worth noting that this data is not sanitised, and is always inserted using `innerHTML`. You should sanitise any
input before providing it to useHead.

## Example

```ts
useHead({
  style: [
    {
      children: `body {color: red}`,
    },
  ],
  noscript: [
    {
      children: `Javascript is required`,
    },
  ],
})
```
