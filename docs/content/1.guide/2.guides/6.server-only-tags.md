Server only tags are tags which are only rendered in a server context. That is, if a `window` is available, they won't be rendered.

## Why Server Tags

Server tags can be useful for rendering tags which wouldn't be possible to render client side or
for performance reasons, avoiding hydration tags which only robots need from the initial page load.

With that in mind, server rendered tags do not have lifecycle events. If you use server rendered tags on a specific
page they won't be automatically removed when you leave the page 

The exception being, if a duplicate tag is registered, they will be replaced.

## Example

Let's look at an example, an about page.

```ts
// pages/about
useServerTagMetaFlat({
  description: 'My about page',
  ogDescription: 'Still about my about page',
  ogTitle: 'About',
  ogImage: 'https://example.com/image.png',
  twitterCard: 'summary_large_image',
})
```

When server-side rendered we'll get the expected tags, however when the client hydrates the code won't be ran.

This means if we move from the `/about` page to a `/contact` page, the tags will still be there.

For meta tags this isn't an issue, but for other tags it can be. 

In these instances you should either avoid using server tags, implement them only in 
root files or implement them with the `key` property so they can be replaced elsewhere.

```ts
// pages/about
useServerHead({
  scripts: [
    {
      src: await import('~/assets/js/about.js?url'),
      key: 'page-script'
    }
  ]
})
```


```ts
// pages/contact
useHead({
  scripts: [
    {
      // This will remove the script from the about page
      key: 'page-script'
    }
  ]
})
```
