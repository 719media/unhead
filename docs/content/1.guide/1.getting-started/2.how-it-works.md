## Unhead

Unhead is a library for managing the `<head>` of your site. It is optimised to be used for both a server side rendered environment and a client side rendered environment.

Internally it is split into several packages which are used to provide the functionality.

- [unhead]() - Core package which provides the API for manipulating the head
- [@unhead/schema]() - Provides the TypeScript types for unhead. 
- [@unhead/dom]() - Manipulating the DOM and collecting the side effects
- [@unhead/ssr]() - Outputting SSR compatible strings to be used in injecting into a template

Integrations have their own packages:
- [@unhead/vue]() - Vue 2/3 integration

## `unhead` 

The Unhead core is a small API which abstracts the common logic for all head integrations. It is designed to be used by any head integration, 
and is not specific to any one framework.

Extensibility and customisation is a core goal of unhead. All internal logic is powered by hooks and plugins, hooks
being provided by [hookable](https://github.com/unjs/hookable).

The API is as follows:

```ts
export interface Unhead<Input extends {} = Head> {
  /**
   * The active head entries.
   */
  headEntries: () => HeadEntry<Input>[]
  /**
   * Create a new head entry.
   */
  push: (entry: Input, options?: HeadEntryOptions) => ActiveHeadEntry<Input>
  /**
   * Resolve tags from head entries.
   */
  resolveTags: () => Promise<HeadTag[]>
  /**
   * Exposed hooks for easier extension.
   */
  hooks: Hookable<HeadHooks>
  /**
   * @internal
   */
  _removeQueuedSideEffect: (key: string) => void
  /**
   * @internal
   */
  _flushQueuedSideEffects: () => void
}
```

### Head entries

Head entries are the data for unhead. They are created by calling `push` on the unhead instance.

An entry is a simple object which contains the tags to be added. Head entries are resolved to tags with the
`resolveTags` method.

```ts
const myFirstEntry = head.push(
  {
    title: 'My title',
    meta: [
      {
        name: 'description',
        content: 'My description',
      },
    ],
  }
)
```

When DOM rendering the tags from a head entry, the side effects are collected with the head entry.

When you dispose or update the entry, these side effects will be cleared.


```ts
myFirstEntry.dispose()
// next time the DOM render is called, the side effects will be cleared
```

Frameworks integrations will abstract these lifecycle functions away, but they are available for custom integrations.

## `@unhead/dom`

When rendering the DOM, unhead will patch the DOM with the tags from the head entries.

To support SSR and hydration, unhead assigns a `data-h-${hash}` key to rendered attributes. 

This allows unhead to identify the tags which are already rendered, and only patch the tags which are missing. It also allows a native deduping between SSR and CSR.

When rendering elements or attributes, side effects are collected with the head entry to dispose of when needed.
