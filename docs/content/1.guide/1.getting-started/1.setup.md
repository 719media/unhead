## Using a framework integration

Framework integrations can provide an abstracted way to handle the frameworks reactivity.

For example in Vue, we use the integration to handle refs and computed getter as input.

While currently only the Vue runtime is built, the package should work in most frameworks with a bit of tinkering.

## Demos

## Install

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn add unhead
```

```bash [npm]
npm install unhead
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add unhead
```

::

## Setup

### 1. Create your head

Start by creating a head instance somewhere in your apps entry.

```ts [main.ts]
// Vue 3
import { createHead } from "unhead"

const head = createHead()
```

### 2. Use the composables

Use the composables anywhere in your application.

```ts
import { useHead } from 'unhead'

useHead({
  title: 'My awesome site'
})
```

### Recommended: Auto Imports

### Next Steps

Your app is now setup for head management, congrats! ðŸŽ‰

The next steps are:
1. Get to know the [composables](/guide/guides/composables)
2. Follow some [recipes](/guide/recipes)
